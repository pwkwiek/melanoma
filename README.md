**Hues of Hazard: Detecting Melanoma Across Color Spaces**

This project explores the influence of different color space models (e.g., RGB, HSV, CIELab) on the performance of neural networks in automated melanoma detection. By combining color space transformations, statistical analysis, and machine learning, we aim to improve early melanoma diagnosis through more accurate and efficient AI tools.
